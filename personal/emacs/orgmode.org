+ [[http://orgmode.org/][Org mode]] is a major mode in Emacs and it is designed for keeping nodes, maitaining TODO lists. And it is also used for authoring documents. 
+ Org mode keep everything in a plain text format so it is really fast and effective to maintain. 
* How I use Org mode 
+ I'm using Org mode for differents purposes:
  1. Keeping todo list for both my work and family.
  2. Record the time for my working tasks.
  3. Weekly review and daily review. 
  4. Maintain my personal blog.
+ To achieve these goals I need to correct configurate my Emacs. My Emacs configurations are in github [[https://github.com/felixyao/dotemacs][dotemacs]]. you can fetch them by git commands:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone git://github.com/felixyao/dotemacs.git
#+END_SRC
